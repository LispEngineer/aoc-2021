## Overview

This year I decided to dust off skills not used since the 80s and
90s to do the solutions in Prolog, using [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)
under Windows. I haven't done serious software development under
Windows in ages, so that's different.

## Getting Started

* Run SWI-Prolog to get to the `?-` command line/REPL.
* Run `emacs.` to get the mini-Emacs-like editor.
* Load the `*.pl` files into the editor for each AoC challenge you want to see.
* Compile the file into the SWI-Prolog REPL with control-c control-b,
  but do it quickly as otherwise it will interpret it as just "copy".
* Run the example answers at the command line. You will have to replace
  the full path of the input files with your correct path. I haven't
  yet figured out how to use a relative path, sorry.
